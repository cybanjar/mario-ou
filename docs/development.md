## First-time setup

We are using npm (instead of yarn) and make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v12+)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) (at least 1.0)

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies from package.json
yarn install
```

## Dev server

```bash
# Launch the dev server
yarn dev
```

Then open your browser and go to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

For login credentials in the testing stage you can use these credentials:

username: `sindata@vhpweb`

password: `system@1016`

Next step is to read the [Architecture Docs](architecture.md)
